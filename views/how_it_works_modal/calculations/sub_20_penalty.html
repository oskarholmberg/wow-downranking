<h4>Spells below level 20</h4>
<p>
	Casting a spell that can be learnt below level 20 incurs a significant penalty to the coefficient of the spell. This was introduced during Vanilla WoW in order to counter the unforseen power of heavily downranking spells.

	The formula for this is:

	<code>[Sub Level 20 Coefficient] = 1 - (Maximum(0, 20 - [Required level for the spell]) * 0.0375)</code>
