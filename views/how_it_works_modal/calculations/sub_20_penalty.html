<h4>Spells below level 20</h4>
<p>
	Casting a spell that is below level 20 incurs a significant penalty to the coefficient of the spell. This was introduced during Vanilla WoW in order to counter the unforseen power of downranking spells a lot.

	The formula for this is:

	<code>(20 - [Spell Level]) * 0.0375 = [Sub Level 20 Penalty]</code>
