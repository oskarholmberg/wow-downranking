			"note": "You should always use the <b class='yellow'>Max Rank</b> of this spell. Holy shock is not very mana efficient nor very powerful when it comes to reliable healing over time, both due to its cooldown, but also since it is an instant spell it does not scale very well with Healing Power. However it is a nice addition when you are on the move, or when you want to deal a bit of damage."
